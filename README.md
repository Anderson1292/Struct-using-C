# Struct using C
Struct is an abbreviation for Structure, which means structure in Portuguese. In the C programming language (and many others) it is a composite data structure that physically defines a list of variables grouped under a name in a block of memory, so all variables can be accessed through a single pointer or what is informed in the structure that returns the same address.

In Struct, it allows you to group several types of data, so it is often used for records of mixed data types, something like a registration that requires several different data (name, address, phone, etc.).

The Struct in C directly references the contiguous block of physical memory, usually delimited (scaled) by word-length limits. The word Struct corresponds to the similarly named feature available in some low-level languages ​​and even Intel. Being a block of contiguous memory, each field within a structure is located at a certain fixed offset from the beginning.
